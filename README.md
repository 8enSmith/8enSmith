## Hi! ðŸ‘‹

:earth_americas: I'm Ben and I'm a full-stack developer based in Cambridge, UK.

:briefcase: I've extensive commercial experience with TypeScript & JavaScript, Node.js, React (including Next.js) and AWS & Azure.

:computer: I'm currently enjoying playing around with AI tooling e.g. GitHub CoPilot, OpenRouter, Ollama and Roo Code (a Cline fork).

Projects I've been developing/playing-with in my free time recently include https://www.book-tok.net (see [here](https://github.com/8enSmith/book-tok)) and creating an MCP server for the Internet Archive's Open Library that enables AI assistants to search for book and author information (see [here](https://github.com/8enSmith/mcp-open-library)).
