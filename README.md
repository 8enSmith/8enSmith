## Hi! 👋

:earth_americas: I'm Ben and I'm a full-stack developer based in Cambridge, UK.

:briefcase: I've extensive commercial experience with TypeScript & JavaScript, Node.js, React (including Next.js) and AWS & Azure.

:computer: I'm currently enjoying playing around with AI tooling and LLMs e.g. GitHub CoPilot, OpenRouter, Ollama and Roo Code (a Cline fork).

🛝 Projects I've been developing in my free time recently include:

* https://www.book-tok.net (see [here](https://github.com/8enSmith/book-tok))
* https://song-summary.vercel.app/ (see [here](https://github.com/8enSmith/song-summary))
* a MCP server for the Internet Archive's Open Library that enables AI assistants to search for book and author information (see [here](https://github.com/8enSmith/mcp-open-library)).
