## Hi! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Ben and I'm a full-stack developer based in Cambridge, UK.

I've extensive commercial experience with TypeScript & JavaScript, Node.js, React (including Next.js) and AWS & Azure.

I'm currently enjoying playing around with AI tooling e.g. GitHub CoPilot, OpenRouter, Ollama and Roo Code (a Cline fork)
